## Project Summary:
Create a sandwich order form that allows the user to select all the ingredients for a custom deli sandwich. Create a Sandwich module, then create individual modules, using IIFE syntax, to augment Sandwich.

<hr>

## Requirements:
1. Modules using IIFE syntax for Bread, Meat, Cheese, Condiments, and Veggies
1. One HTML file with a section of options for each sandwich part
1. Ability to select multiple, or zero, choices for each section
1. Empty DOM element into which the final sandwich order and its cost will be inserted
1. The ingredient choices should be stored as JS objects that contain the ingredients as keys and their cost as the value.
1. Make sure the ingredient objects cannot be accessed by the other modules except through an accessor (getter) method.
1. Each IIFE should expose, in its public interface, a method named add{ingredient} (e.g. addMeat or addVeggies) that accepts a single argument. That argument's value should be the ingredient selected by the user.
1. Additional JavaScript file that handles interacting with the form elements and determining which method should be called.

## Personal Comments:

<!-- This project was mostly about me remembering basic **HTML** and **CSS** from my childhood Myspace days. It was *particularly* satisfying to realize proficiency in **Github** and use the **Terminal** to accomplish everything. -->
